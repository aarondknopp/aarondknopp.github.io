  </section>

  <!-- About section - Use this section to talk about some of my personal characteristics/experiences -->
  
  <section id="about" class="about-section"><h2>About Me</h2>

    <li>I have been a lifelong resident of San Diego County, California, USA. I was born and raised in Escondido, but I moved to Poway when I was nearly twelve and a half, and have resided there ever since.</li>
    <li>I am the oldest of four children â€” I have a sister, as well as two brothers who are fraternal twins, and we all attended different universities.</li>
    <li>The first time I ever went on a computer was when I was a toddler, and the first operating system I used was MS-DOS to load old computer games with CGA-based graphics (which had only four colors: cyan, magenta, white, and black).</li>
    <li>I actually taught myself how to read at the age of four.</li>
    <li>Working has been a consistent part of my adult life: I began working part-time during my senior year in high school, and then held two part-time jobs while attending college: one while at community college, and later, a different job throughout my university years.</li>
    <li>I am currently employed as the Instructional Assistant for the NFAR Tech program at the National Foundation for Autism Research (NFAR).</li>
    </section>

  <!-- Values section - Unlike the previous section, this section will focus on my positive/desirable attributes as an employee -->

    <section id="values" class="values-section"><h2>What I Value</h2>

    <li>When I work, I focus on ensuring that both products and processes contain a high level of quality.</li>
    <li>I also believe in trying to get a job done as well as possible the first time around.</li>
    <li>However ... I also value a positive and collaborative work environment, where everybody respects one another and tries to work together to accomplish common objectives.</li>
    <li>Additionally, if I know that somebody needs assistance, I am glad to provide it (or refer them to a source that I know can help them if I myself am not able or qualified).</li>
